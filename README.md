# Lottery Winning Combination Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting winning combinations for lottery tickets using association rule mining techniques implemented in R with the arules package.

## Objective üéØ
The objective of this project is to analyze transaction data from lottery tickets and identify association rules that can help predict winning combinations. By mining these rules, we aim to uncover patterns and relationships among ticket numbers to enhance the chances of selecting winning combinations in future lottery draws.

## Getting Started üöÄ
To get started with this project, you'll need to have R installed on your system. You can download R from the [official R website](https://www.r-project.org/). Additionally, you'll need to install the arules package, which can be done by running the following command in your R console:

```R
install.packages("arules")

**### Usage ‚ÑπÔ∏è**
Data Preparation: Ensure you have the Mahzooz.csv file containing your lottery ticket data. If not, replace it with your own dataset. Make sure the data is in CSV format and contains the transaction information of lottery tickets.

Code Execution:

Library Import: This line imports the arules package, which provides functions for association rule mining in R.
